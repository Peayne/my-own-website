# Boilerplate

Boilerplate to use at the start of your new project.

# How to use it

It uses [Prepros](https://prepros.io/) as processor.

Drag and drop the folder into Prepros, everything will be already configured.

Before using the automatic processing file the first time you use it, you have to manually click on "Process File" on assets/scripts/main.js and assets/styles/main.scss.

After this, all changes will be compiled automatically. Enjoy.
